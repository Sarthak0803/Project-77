    <h1>Project on Console</h1>

    <p>
        Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go) and runtimes (such as .NET and Unity).

    <p>
        The Console method log() outputs a message to the web console. The message may be a single string (with optional substitution values), or it may be any one or more JavaScript objects.
    </p>

    <script>
        console.log("my first console project");

        var first_name = "Sarthak";
        console.log(first_name);

        var last_name  = "Sharma";
        console.log(last_name);

        var full_name = first_name.concat(last_name);
        console.log(full_name);

        var number_1 = 22;
        var number_2 = 3;
        console.log(number_1 + number_2);

        var number_1 = 22;
        var number_2 = 3;
        console.log(number_1 - number_2);

        var number_1 = 22;
        var number_2 = 3;
        console.log(number_1 * number_2);

        var number_1 = 22;
        var number_2 = 3;
        console.log(number_1 / number_2)
